**Before**
- Liquidity is uniform among all prices

**Problem**

- Liquidity on low volatile terms of trade is inefficiently allocated on price tails.

**Implications**

- Not having liquidity located on areas where the terms of trade move causes structural information costs for traders, then they pary higher cost for information incorporation but no information is being incorporated, this is market inefficient

**Solution**
- Eficcient allocation of liquidity on prices where trading volume is, wich corrresponds to prices where liquidity is actually needed.



## Objective:

### Requirement: Concentrated Liquidity

- Mechanism for liquidity providers to select price ranges where they enable liquidity to the market to be consumed by traders
