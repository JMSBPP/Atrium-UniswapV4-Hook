# Dynamic Fee Market Resilience Mechanism

## Purpose
- Maximize the market resilience, (elasticity of internal terms of trade with respect to external updated terms of trade) through differential swap fee adjustments 


### Requirements:
- Track internally quoted prices and external prices on each block
- 


### Exclussions:

- The maximization is for a market resilience only with respect to what can be done on fees, not other mechanism like enabling conditional elastic terms of trade witth respect to elasticity levels.
